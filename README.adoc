# CoAP Sources and Processor

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Application_Protocol[CoAP] is a RESTful web transfer protocol specialized for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks in the Internet of Things (IoT).

The SCDF CoAP modules, integrate with the CoAP networks, allowing to monitor or update the CoAP resources (sensors, controller, lamps ..) in real time.
The `coap:` and `coaps:` protocol schemas are supported allowing `UDP` and `DTLS` transports. The `coap-server` source application is a `CoAP Server` itself and as such can receive
CoAP requests directly from other CoAP resources.

TIP: The https://github.com/tzolov/coap-shell[CoAP Shell] can help to test and explore the CoAP app starters.


To learn more about this application and the supported properties, please review the following link.

## CoAP Observe Source
Subscribes to CoAP `observable` resources. Listens for CoAP resource updates and emits the body as a message payload.

## CoAP Server Source
Acts as a CoAP Server, listens for CoAP requests and emits the body as a message payload.

## CoAP Client processor
On input message, send a request to an external CoAP Resource and emits the response body as a message payload to the output
